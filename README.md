# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository provides a comprehensive overview of Requirement Analysis In The Software Development Lifecycle 
The goal is to document, analyze, and understand user needs and project goals before system design and implementation begin.
It serves as a guide for software engineers, product managers, and stakeholders who want to ensure that software solutions are built on clearly defined and validated requirements.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is one of the most important steps in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It involves gathering and understanding what the software should do and how it should work. The goal is to make sure everyone—developers, clients, and users agree on the system's needs before building it.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
**Clear Understanding**: It helps the team know exactly what the users want, avoiding confusion.

**Defines Scope**: It sets clear boundaries for the project to prevent adding features that were not planned.

**Guides Design and Development**: It gives developers a clear guide on how to build the software.

**Helps Estimate Time and Cost**: With clear requirements, it’s easier to plan how long the project will take and how much it will cost.

**Ensures Quality**: The final product is checked against these requirements to make sure it meets user needs.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
 **Requirement Gathering**
	-Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
	-Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
  -Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
  -Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
  -Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.
**Requirement Elicitation**
  *Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
  *Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
  *Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.
**Requirement Documentation**
  *Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
  *User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user’s perspective.
  *Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.
**Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  *Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
  *Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
  *Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.
**Requirement Validation**
  *Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
  *Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
  *Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

  ## Types of Requirements
  **Functional Requirements**
**Definition**: Describe what the system should do.
**Examples**: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.
**Key Functional Requirements:**
    **Search Properties: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
    **User Registration: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
	  **Property Listings: Display properties with essential details and images.
    **Booking System: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
    **User Authentication: Secure login and registration process for users.
**Non-functional Requirements**
**Definition**: Describe how the system should perform.
**Examples**: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.
**Key Non-functional Requirements**:
    **Performance: The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
    **Security: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
    **Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
    **Usability: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
    **Reliability: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.
